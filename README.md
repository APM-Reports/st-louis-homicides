# About the data
This dataset contains more than 3,000 homicides reported by the Saint Louis Metropolitan Police Department between 2004 and 2023.

It was compiled from spreadsheets and homicide incident reports provided by the Saint Louis Metropolitan Police Department as part of a settlement by the city of St. Louis with Minnesota Public Radio, the parent company of APM Reports.

# About the definitions
We relied on the police department's designation of cases as homicides, which typically result in charges of murder or willful manslaughter. Homicides deemed by the police as justifiable -- when police officer officers or private citizens kill someone who was alelgedly committing -- were excluded from this dataset.

`clearance_status` can either be 'closed' or 'open'. 'Closed' cases are either cleared by arrest or cleared exceptionally (ie. when police have fully identified a suspect but cannot take them into custody)

Our analysis relied on the police department’s determinations of victims’ races.
